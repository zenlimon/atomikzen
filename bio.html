      	<p>I earned my BFA at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where the teaching philosophy is an extension of the Bauhaus in Dessau before the WW2; that good design is when form follows function. I learned design aesthetics, illustrative storytelling, and the physics of light; how we see color.</p>

		<p>Aesthetics are in all our senses, not just the sight. I truly enjoy the mathematics of art and how it displays aesthetics; Fibonacci and Descartes excite me. Plutonic forms exemplify simplicity; Euclid defines it. The physics and mathematics of color can entertain me for hours; the Hexadecimal system fascinates me.  Color, as the brain perceives it, is nothing more than the interpretation of various waves lengths gathered by our cones and passed on to our ventral occipital lobe.</p>
 
		<p>One of my favorite positions was being the lead colorist on a development team creating new cartoons including the backstories of the character as well as the color. I flourished working with a team, each doing our part to create the whole to be pitched to the networks. I would also design the color for the shows once they were picked up by the network.</p>

		<p>As companies bought out companies, and after the dust settled from the layoffs, I focused my attention on learning 3D modeling and animation. I focused not only on the polygonal aspects of a workable model, but the textures and the lighting to create realistic environments for video games and architectural renderings</p>

		<p>For several years, I taught these skills to colleges students, focusing on aesthetics and composition. I also taught myself how to create websites as I was forever perfecting my own portfolio site.</p>
